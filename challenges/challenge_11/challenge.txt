This week, we will be writing our UnitTests while we write our program.
Winners will the ones whose code runs in the least amount of time, AND whose code is written with the fewest lines of code. (Code golf)
Bonus points to be awarded for using a coding method that we have not seen/used before in our challenges (decorators, static functions, new design patterns, etc)

Program Parameters:
We will be writing a program….
“The program should take three arguments. The first will be a day, the second will be month, and the third will be year. Then, your program should compute the day of the week that date will fall on.”

Accepted Inputs:
3 arguments as integers
1st = day
2nd = month
3rd = year

Accepted Outputs:
All outputs should be formatted as strings
Valid Dates:

•	Monday
•	Tuesday
•	Wednesday
•	Thursday
•	Friday
•	Saturday
•	Sunday

Invalid Dates:

•	Invalid Date

•	Ex. 2/29/2017
•	Ex. 13/38/2016
•	Ex. Jan/8/2017 (string instead of integer)



Note:
We will be using the Gregorian Calendar for our program.
I cannot find exact measurements on how far out its accuracy allows us (I think something along the lines 1 day in ~3,300 years)
Let’s go to the extremes and see how accurate we can get, and then argue about it during our meeting 
