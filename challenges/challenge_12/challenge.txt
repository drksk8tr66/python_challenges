This week’s Python Challenge, we will be kicking it up a notch by moving to the Intermediate Challenges!

This challenge, we will be creating a Text Adventure Game.

SRC:
create a short text adventure that will call the user by their name.
The text adventure should use standard text adventure commands ("l, n, s, e, i, etc.").
for extra credit, make sure the program doesn't fault, quit, glitch, fail, or loop no matter what is put in, even empty text or spaces.

While making a game is fun, let’s build a game together, and create something awesome!
During this meeting, we will be discussing how we have come up with what we have, and how to integrate them together.
The end results should be that we wrap all of our “levels” together into a Text Adventure Epic for use during our next meeting on Oct. 7th.
