For this challenge, we will be working with some Rackspace Internal Systems.
Our goal is to first obtain a token from Rackspace Identity to be used in later API calls to our various systems.
You will be using this code to auth against different RS systems in later challenges.

We will need to store the Token ID and the Token Expiration Date for use later on while not publishing any credentials.


We will obtain a token from the following URL.
'https://identity-internal.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/tokens'
The preferred module for making these API calls is the 'requests' module.
Use the .gitignore file to ignore any files that have your credentials in them from being pushed up to GitHub.
Example File: bitools/bitools/tokens.py

Things to keep in mind:
Security
Security
SECURITY!
Anyone who pushes their credentials to GitHub fails instantly and will be asked to buy drinks for everyone!
