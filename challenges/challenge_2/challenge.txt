Hello, coders! An important part of programming is being able to apply your programs.
So your challenge for today is to create a calculator application that has use in your life.
We will be making a Force Calculator using F = M * A.
EXTRA CREDIT: make the calculator have multiple functions!
Not only should it be able to calculate F = M * A, but also A = F/M, and M = F/A!
