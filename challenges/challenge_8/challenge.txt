This week, we will be writing a program that will allow the user to input digits, and arrange them in numerical order.
For Bonus Points, we will also accepts strings to be re-ordered alphabetically.
	-I am not putting any constraints on how we should treat strings with whitespace (words), I want to see what we all come up with 
For Super Bonus Points, let’s allow the use of integers, floats, decimals, and any other numerical data types that you can think of.
	-Keep the data type, scale, and precision for all values entered, then order them numerically.
