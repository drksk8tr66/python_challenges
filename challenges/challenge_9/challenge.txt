"""
This week’s Python challenge will depend on last week’s challenge.
We will be writing a Unit Test for our functions we built during Challenge #8.
Our Challenge #8 output should be in the form of an order/sorted list.

Our unit tests must be able to test the functionality of the functions that we wrote.

Bonus points for being able to test other peoples code for Challenge #8.

Please refer to JJ’s Unit Test for Challenge #8 for examples of how to accomplish this.
